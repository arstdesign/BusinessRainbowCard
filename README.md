##Project Overview

###What I Learned

The aim of this project was to create a single page business card website in HTML & CSS, with links to various contacts a visitor may want to explore to learn more about me. I have some experience with this type of coding language, but a lot is different compared to the last time I used it, so I learned a lot about the usage of SVGs and grid positioning. I created links, animated images, and even learned how to give my heavily stylized website a custom server. I also implemented to the best of my ability secondary positioning for mobile view, so the site can be accessed anywhere. I got to get back into the flow of using HTML & CSS again and how I can use it to make new and exciting things.

###Problem Solving & Accessibility

I used alt tags on my links and other images to make my website more accessible for sight impaired people. I also tried my best to make sure the colors I used worked together in a way that was easy for viewers to see, as well as choosing fonts that are fun, but also still readable.

###Features, Fonts, Design & Mockups

I wanted to use a playful vintage inspired design for this website, as I thought its a style that most represents me and my personality as an artist and designer. I used rainbow and sky imagery to create this design, a striped rainbow takes up the bottom right corner of the page, and clouds are scattered throughout, some containing visible links to various social media and design related accounts. I included a monogram I created for myself as well as my name in the google font Modak, with my work title in Chicle. Some clouds not containing likes I had animated to float about the page at different intervals to add some whimsical movement to the page. TO add to this theme, I also gave my website a custom cursor in the form of a bumble bee, who stings any link she hovers over. I created most of my assets in Adobe Illustrator, and made mockups in FigJam, as well as planning out all my elements physically on paper.
